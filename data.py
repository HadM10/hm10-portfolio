    "about": {
        "1": "I am a dedicated full-stack and mobile developer with a passion for creating seamless digital experiences. My journey in technology began with a deep fascination for computer science, which led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science at the Lebanese International University (LIU). My academic foundation, coupled with hands-on experience, has equipped me with a robust understanding of both front-end and back-end development. ",
        "2": "After my formal education, I further honed my skills by completing a five-month, full-time bootcamp at ESA Coding Lab, ESIEE IT, and ESA Business School. During this intensive program, I became proficient in the MERN stack and acquired a broad array of technologies that have become essential tools in my development toolkit. This experience not only solidified my technical expertise but also instilled a strong sense of discipline and adaptability.",
        "3": "I thrive in collaborative environments where innovation and creativity are at the forefront. My ability to communicate effectively and adapt quickly ensures that I can contribute meaningfully to any team, driving projects to successful outcomes. While I am fully capable of working independently, I believe that being part of a professional team can accelerate my career and amplify my impact.",
        "4": "Outside the realm of technology, I am a music composer and piano player. Music serves as a source of inspiration and creativity, allowing me to approach problem-solving with a unique perspective. The harmonies and rhythms of music often translate into innovative ideas in my development work, fostering a continuous cycle of creativity and technical excellence."
